The first half was all Ghana, as Mohammed Salisu scored a goal in 24’ and Mohammed Kudus scored in 34’. Ghana almost went up by three, but were unable to put in a header. South Korea would come back with two header goals by Cho Gue-Sung in 58’ and 61’. Ghana responded quickly with another goal by Mohammed Kudus in the 68th minute.

Despite appearing to be in pain while on the field, Rodgers said that he is not ruling out next week against the Bears if he checks out fine this week. He is scheduled for X-Rays today. Jordan Love came in relief of Rodgers and immediately led the Green Bay Packers on a scoring drive.
